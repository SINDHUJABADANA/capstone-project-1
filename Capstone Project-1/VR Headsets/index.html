    		<h2 class="Q">IS VR BAD FOR YOUR BRAIN ?</h2>
    		<p>Currently, standard virtual reality systems use either virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments to generate some realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. </p>
    		<br>
    		<p><b>One method by which virtual reality can be realized is simulation-based virtual reality. Driving simulators, for example, give the driver on board the impression of actually driving an actual vehicle by predicting vehicular motion caused by driver input and feeding back corresponding visual, motion and audio cues to the driver.</b></p

    		<p class="a3">Immersive learning enhances the learning process by adding content that is interactive and engaging, allowing for experimentation, practice, and learning by doing. This greatly appeals to an insatiable curiosity residing in young learners, and due to the possibility of multiple instances of connecting with key concepts, enables learners to work at their own pace and to their level of proficiency.Using VR Tech, any learner understands complex scientific concepts with fun and ease, for example, when a student uses Virtual Reality to understand “Respiration System in a human body” the student will understand that while breathing, so many gaseous elements go inside the lungs and how the oxygen is filtered from the other elements and how it will bound with RCB.</p>
